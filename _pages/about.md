My name is Kevin Lower, and I am a PhD candidate in Philosophy at Villanova University. Lately, I spend most of my time thinking about mind, metaphysics, and the history of science in the early modern period. In particular, I focus on the philosophy of Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle (1623-1673). You can find information about my ongoing projects on this website.

My dissertation is titled "Margaret Cavendish's Metaphysics of Action and Passion". It argues that Margaret Cavendish develops conceptually-intertwined accounts of action, passion, and sympathy. I am especially interested in how these concepts elucidate the metaphysical underpinnings of her theories of freedom, causation, and materiality.

I also organize a reading and research group on Cavendish's philosophical writings. Feel free to join us by visiting [our website](https://thecavendishcollective.weebly.com/)!
