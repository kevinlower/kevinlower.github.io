My name is Kevin Lower, and I am a PhD candidate in Philosophy at Villanova University. Lately, I spend most of my days thinking about mind and metaphysics in the early modern period. In particular, I focus on the philosophy of Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle (1623-1673). You can find information about my ongoing projects on this website.

My dissertation is titled "Margaret Cavendish's Metaphysics of Action and Passion". It argues that Margaret Cavendish's conceptions of action, passion, and metaphysical sympathy are thoroughly intertwined. I am especially interested in how these concepts elucidate the metaphysical underpinnings of her theories of freedom, causation, and materiality.

I also organize a reading and research group on Cavendish's philosophical writings. Feel free to join us by visiting [our website](https://thecavendishcollective.weebly.com/)!
